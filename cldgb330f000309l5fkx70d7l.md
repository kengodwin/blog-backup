# Bootstrap 5 Darkness

One of the first things to work on when embarking on a new web project is developing a style guide. It can be a variation of Bootstrap or something invented from whole cloth. The important thing is the fact it is usable.

So this is the style guide for OpenMonitors.com which is just a variation of Bootstrap's dark theme plus integrating a couple of other libraries (one for icons, another for check/radio/switches) that look better than the default Bootstrap content.

The reason it is just a bootstrap variant is that it is meant for developing an MVP ASAP rather than being an impressive project in its own right.

You can view it at the link below:

Once I get the MVP done for this project, I might work on building a separate identity for the theme beyond "yet another bootstrap customization". We'll see.
