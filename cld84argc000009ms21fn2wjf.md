# Goals Setting for Developers Unchained

TL;DR My goal is $2,000 in net income per month.

Building in public is part marketing ploy, part journal of a journey. I find both useful so I’ll be building in public. I don’t view it as bragging simply because I started from $0 and 0 followers/users. This is a 100% new identity with the exception of a much neglected LinkedIn I might be using to promote stuff.

The thing with DevOps tooling is it's either open source “user beware” or SaaS with no transparency. Both things have their place but I’d prefer tools where I knew the people behind, their goals, their journey. Maybe that makes me strange. I don’t know.

I’m a solo founder at the moment for a variety of reasons, the main one is for a lifestyle business I’m not sure the value added of a cofounder is relevant. I don’t need to pitch to investors or spend a ton of money on marketing. I also will learn relevant skills to building a business if I don’t have the crutch of a business/marketer person with the risk I screw it up. However, when you start at zero, the only way to go is up.

My goal for Developers Unchained is a significant side income ($2000/month net profit or $50/hr @ 10hrs/week for 28 days a month). This is partially because I tend towards what I consider a realistic world view, partially because unless I’m the exception to the rule I’ll never hit an annual profit that is job replacement worthy.

I enjoy working remote and genuinely never want to go back to the office. So if something happens and I can’t find remote work quickly, the hope is Developers Unchained can allow me to stretch things to the point I get what I want. So the other purpose of this is my backup plan for not finding traditional remote work. But realistically, I’d need a minimum of $120,000 in net profit a year (1500 billable hours @ $80/hr) for this to be an effective job replacement mechanism with the extra taxes and benefits required for being self employed.

I honestly don’t expect to clear $10k/month running this thing. So that backup plan is wishful thinking.
