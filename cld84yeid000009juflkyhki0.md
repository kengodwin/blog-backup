# Week 1 - Friday Retrospective

These are mostly written for me to keep track of things so expect low quality. I probably will knock this down to monthly since a draft for the month then followed by a publish probably will be more impactful and feel less like noise.

The goal for these updates is to list:

* What I‚Äôve built (shipped or otherwise)
    
* What I think I‚Äôve fixed (shipped or otherwise)
    
* Any musings about the future.
    
* Any musings in general.
    

### This week:

* I‚Äôve written a proof of concept in go for monitoring the things that need monitoring. So I‚Äôm happy about that.
    
* I‚Äôve signed up for the basic SaaS stuff I need to. I
    
* ‚Äôll be transferring the payment methods and stuff once I setup a LLC but that is for later.
    
* I‚Äôve posted a little on this blog to get things started. Nothing too important though, no one will care until the beta and I have no plans to promote this blog until it's time to promote a product.
    

### The future:

Next week I will be moving on the 27th if all goes as planned. So that will disrupt my life for probably ~3 weeks. So I may (or may not) skip the retrospectives during that time. Even if the hours I spend on this stuff dips, I may have something to say to myself since that is the only audience right now.

I‚Äôm limiting myself to a planned 10 hours a week because that is about all the productivity I can expect. I work a full time job as a developer which limits my options. Going much over about 50 hours a week quickly hurts my productivity in general so that‚Äôs best avoided.

The timeline I have in mind is shipping 1 product a year with about 2 years of support. So that is theoretically 3 projects I could be maintaining at any given time. That seems a reasonable limit if I had more time, it is very ambitious on 10 hours a week.

Customer service is going to be a very clear and obvious problem with the limitations above. I‚Äôm not a very social person and burning even 5 hours a week on customer service will greatly reduce my productivity. I‚Äôm not sure how to solve that with a lean bootstrapped business with $0 in the budget for employees. Probably some sort of public community/feedback process that keeps people waiting for me to answer questions.

I could also bite the bullet and work myself harder than is wise for short periods but that is an emergency band aid and not a serious solution.

The other problem is as a solo founder, its really going to be a ‚Äúcustomer tested‚Äù product which is rough on any business. I‚Äôll test stuff but there is a reason businesses normally have a QA process beyond ‚ÄúDev tests then pushes to production‚Äù.

### Musings

I‚Äôve silo‚Äôd my Developers Unchained identity in a world (fresh install of Google Chrome) without uBlock and pihole for as long as I can stand it. I need to see the ads and process them analytically if I am going to spend money on that sort of thing in the future. I only use this for ‚Äúside project‚Äù work so its less intrusive than if I shut that stuff off everywhere.

So that‚Äôs it for this update. We‚Äôll see how things go with the move üôÇ
